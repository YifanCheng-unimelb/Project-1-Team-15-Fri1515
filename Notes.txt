Design issues:
- Different shapes have extensive amount of repetition 
	(Create e.g Shape class to inherite from; Improve readability; Reduce disk space usage)
- Under Tetris, large amount of repetitive code
	(Rewrite the code)
- Redefine of variables
	(Delete unneccessary code)
- slowDown in Tetris is slowing down rather than accelerating
	(Change direction of signs)
- Logic of start button is not correct, game start without any input, currently serves the
  purpose a restart button
	(Change the logic of the start function)
- Gameover is currently not centered
	(Change position values to improve the visualisation)
